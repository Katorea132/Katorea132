### What is my relationship with programming?
Basically I find in programming a tool to make whatever on earth I want. Making creative and new ways to solve any given problem [sparks joy](https://youtu.be/WvyeapVBLWY?t=22) in my heart and with a powerful tool such as programming, I've been having nothing but fun!

### What do I do besides programming?
  - Been learning how to draw, royally suck at it but I'm improving through constant practice! ([This place](https://drawabox.com/) is a great resource to start!)
  - I love languages in general, so far I only know english and spanish, but have been learning japanese for a while now (not quite enough to claim that I speak it) and my eyes are also on french, SoonTM.
  - Enjoy music a lot, I know how to play the bass and I'm trying to learn to play the piano, can't read scores though, working on that!
